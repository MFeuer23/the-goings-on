### Summary
“The Goings On” utilizes a React/Redux client side, and a Rails API backend to show information about the most recent natural events based on the parameters selected.

“The Goings On” was made possible by [NASA’s EONET API](https://eonet.sci.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/v2.1). They have very comprehensive documentation and a really cool functional web app of their own, that shows natural events based on different parameters. Check it out! It’s called [Worldview](https://worldview.earthdata.nasa.gov/).
